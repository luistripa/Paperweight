            <p>
                Paperweight is a lightweight document database that helps in storing
                any kind of documents (invoices, instruction manuals, etc.) that are often placed in chunky dossiers
                that are a pain to search through.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paperweight lets users create digital dossiers that resemble the physical ones, only with a lot more flexibility.
                Sections can be created in each dossier to further improve the organization of documents.
            </p>
